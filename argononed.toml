# List below the temperature (Celsius) and fan speed (in percent) pairs
# Use the following form:
# temperatures = [ min_temp_0, min_temp_1]
# speeds = [ fan_speed_0, fan_speed_1]

# Example: default fan settings:
# temperatures = [ 55, 60, 65, ]
# speeds = [ 10, 55, 100, ]

# Example: fan always ON
# temperatures = [ 0 ]
# speeds = [ 100 ]
